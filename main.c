/* Algorithm:
 * â˜‘ get the expression string
 * - build a syntax tree using an inorder binary tree traversal with operator
 * precedence (syntax analysis)
 * - evaluate syntax tree
 *
 * The Syntax Tree
 * For my chosen operators +, -, *, / an array representation of the syntax
 * tree would be sufficient because the syntax tree is binary. The more
 * general solution would require a data structure that can handle an n-ary
 * tree due to having operators that can have more than two operators. In this
 * case a linked list would work.
